This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

However, here are some of the most common and widely recognized methods of data mining, often grouped by the type of task they perform:\n\n**1. Classification:**\n\nThis method aims to assign items to predefined categories or classes. It's about predicting a categorical label.\n\n*   **Decision Trees:** Tree-like structures where internal nodes represent tests on attributes, branches represent outcomes of the tests, and leaf nodes represent class labels.\n    *   *Algorithms:* ID3, C4.5, CART (Classification and Regression Trees)\n*   **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** A powerful algorithm that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.\n*   **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the \"naive\" assumption of independence between features.\n*   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies a data point based on the majority class of its 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n*   **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.\n*   **Neural Networks (specifically for classification):** Multi-layered networks of interconnected nodes that learn complex patterns.\n\n**2. Regression:**\n\nThis method aims to predict a continuous numerical value. It's about forecasting a quantity.\n\n*   **Linear Regression:** Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.\n*   **Polynomial Regression:** Extends linear regression by allowing for polynomial relationships between variables.\n*   **Decision Trees (for regression):** Similar to classification trees, but leaf nodes predict a continuous value.\n*   **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** An adaptation of SVMs for regression tasks.\n*   **Neural Networks (specifically for regression):** Can be used to predict continuous values.\n\n**3. Clustering:**\n\nThis method aims to group similar data points together into clusters without prior knowledge of the groups. It's about discovering inherent groupings.\n\n*   **K-Means Clustering:** An iterative algorithm that partitions data into 'k' clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.\n*   **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters, either by starting with individual data points and merging them (agglomerative) or by starting with one large cluster and splitting it (divisive).\n*   **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Groups together points that are closely packed together, marking points in low-density regions as outliers.\n*   **Mean-Shift Clustering:** A non-parametric clustering algorithm that finds modes (peaks) in the data distribution.\n\n**4. Association Rule Mining:**\n\nThis method aims to discover interesting relationships or associations between items in a dataset, often expressed as \"if-then\" rules.\n\n*   **Apriori Algorithm:** A classic algorithm for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules. It uses a breadth-first search approach.\n*   **FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth):** An efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets that avoids the costly candidate generation step of Apriori.\n\n**5. Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):**\n\nThis method aims to identify data points that deviate significantly from the norm or expected behavior.\n\n*   **Statistical Methods:** Using statistical measures like z-scores or standard deviations to identify outliers.\n*   **Distance-Based Methods:** Identifying points that are far from their neighbors.\n*   **Density-Based Methods:** Identifying points in low-density regions (similar to DBSCAN).\n*   **Machine Learning Models:** Using classification or clustering models to identify anomalies.\n\n**6. Sequential Pattern Mining:**\n\nThis method aims to discover frequently occurring ordered sequences of events in a dataset.\n\n*   **GSP (Generalized Sequential Patterns):** An algorithm for mining sequential patterns.\n*   **PrefixSpan (Prefix-Projected Sequential Pattern Mining):** An efficient algorithm that avoids candidate generation.\n\n**7. Text Mining:**\n\nThis method applies data mining techniques to unstructured text data to extract meaningful information.\n\n*   **Tokenization:** Breaking text into individual words or phrases.\n*   **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form.\n*   **Stop Word Removal:** Eliminating common words that don't carry much meaning.\n*   **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** A statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.\n*   **Topic Modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA):** Discovering abstract \"topics\" that occur in a collection of documents.\n\n**8. Time Series Analysis:**\n\nThis method focuses on analyzing data points collected over time to identify trends, seasonality, and make forecasts.\n\n*   **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** A statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data.\n*   **Exponential Smoothing:** A forecasting technique that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.\n\n**Key Considerations When Choosing a Method:**\n\n*   **The Goal of the Analysis:** What do you want to achieve? Prediction, grouping, finding relationships, etc.?\n*   **Type of Data:** Is it numerical, categorical, text, time-series?\n*   **Size of the Dataset:** Some algorithms are more scalable than others.\n*   **Interpretability:** How important is it to understand *why* a model makes a certain prediction?\n*   **Computational Resources:** Some methods are more computationally intensive.\n\nThis list covers the most common methods. The field of data mining is constantly evolving, with new algorithms and variations emerging regularly."

These methods are designed to extract valuable patterns, insights, and knowledge from large datasets. They can be broadly categorized based on the type of task they perform. Here are the most common methods of data mining:\n\n**1. Classification:**\n\nThis is a supervised learning technique where the goal is to assign data points to predefined categories or classes. The algorithm learns from a labeled dataset (where the class of each data point is known) and then predicts the class of new, unseen data.\n\n*   **Common Algorithms:**\n    *   **Decision Trees:** Tree-like structures that use a series of rules to classify data.\n    *   **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Algorithms that find the optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.\n    *   **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.\n    *   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies a data point based on the majority class of its 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space.\n    *   **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model that uses a logistic function to predict the probability of a binary outcome.\n    *   **Neural Networks (especially Multi-layer Perceptrons):** Complex models inspired by the human brain, capable of learning intricate patterns.\n\n**2. Regression:**\n\nSimilar to classification, regression is also a supervised learning technique. However, instead of predicting a categorical label, regression aims to predict a continuous numerical value.\n\n*   **Common Algorithms:**\n    *   **Linear Regression:** Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.\n    *   **Polynomial Regression:** Extends linear regression to model non-linear relationships by using polynomial terms.\n    *   **Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression:** Regularized versions of linear regression that help prevent overfitting.\n    *   **Decision Trees (for Regression):** Similar to classification trees, but predict a continuous value at the leaf nodes.\n    *   **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** An adaptation of SVMs for regression tasks.\n    *   **Neural Networks:** Can also be used for regression by adjusting the output layer and loss function.\n\n**3. Clustering:**\n\nThis is an unsupervised learning technique where the goal is to group data points into clusters such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. There are no predefined labels.\n\n*   **Common Algorithms:**\n    *   **K-Means Clustering:** An iterative algorithm that partitions data into 'k' clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and their assigned cluster centroids.\n    *   **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a hierarchy of clusters, either by starting with individual data points and merging them (agglomerative) or by starting with one large cluster and splitting it (divisive).\n    *   **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Groups together points that are closely packed together, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions.\n    *   **Mean-Shift Clustering:** A non-parametric clustering algorithm that finds modes (peaks) in the data distribution.\n\n**4. Association Rule Mining:**\n\nThis method aims to discover interesting relationships or associations between items in a dataset, often used in market basket analysis. It identifies rules of the form \"If A, then B\" where A and B are sets of items.\n\n*   **Common Algorithms:**\n    *   **Apriori:** A classic algorithm that uses a breadth-first search approach to find frequent itemsets.\n    *   **FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth):** An efficient algorithm that uses a tree-based structure to mine frequent itemsets without generating candidate sets.\n    *   **Eclat (Equivalence Class Transformation):** Uses a depth-first search approach and set intersections to find frequent itemsets.\n\n**5. Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):**\n\nThis technique focuses on identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm or expected behavior. Anomalies can represent errors, rare events, or fraudulent activities.\n\n*   **Common Algorithms:**\n    *   **Statistical Methods:** Using z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), or other statistical measures to identify outliers.\n    *   **Distance-Based Methods:** Identifying points that are far from their neighbors (e.g., using KNN).\n    *   **Density-Based Methods:** Identifying points in low-density regions (e.g., DBSCAN can also be used for anomaly detection).\n    *   **Machine Learning Models:** Using classification or clustering models to identify outliers as points that don't fit well into any cluster or are misclassified.\n    *   **Isolation Forest:** An ensemble method that isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the minimum and maximum values of that feature.\n\n**6. Sequential Pattern Mining:**\n\nThis method is used to discover frequently occurring ordered patterns in sequential data, such as customer purchase histories, web clickstreams, or DNA sequences.\n\n*   **Common Algorithms:**\n    *   **GSP (Generalized Sequential Patterns):** An extension of the Apriori algorithm for sequential data.\n    *   **SPADE (Sequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence Classes):** Uses a vertical data format and set intersections for efficiency.\n    *   **PrefixSpan (Prefix-Projected Sequential Pattern Mining):** A pattern-growth approach that avoids candidate generation.\n\n**7. Text Mining:**\n\nThis involves extracting meaningful information and patterns from unstructured text data. It often combines natural language processing (NLP) techniques with data mining methods.\n\n*   **Common Techniques:**\n    *   **Tokenization:** Breaking text into words or phrases.\n    *   **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form.\n    *   **Stop Word Removal:** Eliminating common words that don't carry much meaning.\n    *   **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** A statistical measure to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.\n    *   **Topic Modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA):** Discovering abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents.\n    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the emotional tone of text.\n\n**8. Time Series Analysis:**\n\nThis method deals with analyzing time-ordered sequences of data points to identify trends, seasonality, and forecast future values.\n\n*   **Common Techniques:**\n    *   **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** A widely used statistical model for time series forecasting.\n    *   **Exponential Smoothing:** Methods that assign exponentially decreasing weights to past observations.\n    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory):** Deep learning models well-suited for sequential data.\n\n**Key Considerations When Choosing a Method:**\n\n*   **The Goal of the Analysis:** What do you want to achieve? (e.g., predict a value, group similar items, find relationships).\n*   **Type of Data:** Is it structured, unstructured, sequential, or time-series?\n*   **Labeled vs. Unlabeled Data:** Do you have predefined categories for your data?\n*   **Scalability:** Can the method handle the size of your dataset?\n*   **Interpretability:** How important is it to understand *why* a certain prediction or pattern was found?\n\nThis comprehensive overview covers the most common and powerful methods in the data mining arsenal. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice often depends on the specific problem and dataset at hand."

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

        "When applying `langextract` to another movie review PDF, the extracted entities are generally reasonable: most clear opinions on plot, characters, visuals, and soundtrack are captured as `opinion_statement`, while phrases describing viewers’ reactions are labeled as `audience_impact`. This shows that the combination of a focused prompt and good examples is effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, some limitations can appear. Subtle or implicit opinions might be missed, and occasionally a single long sentence containing multiple opinions is grouped into a single extraction. In addition, some attributes (e.g., `key_phrase` or `emotion_evoked`) may be a bit generic or not perfectly aligned with what a human annotator would choose.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the options exposed in the code and the documentation, there are several ways to improve the results:\n",
        "- **Increase `extraction_passes`** above 1 to improve recall by letting the model scan the text multiple times.\n",
        "- **Adjust `max_char_buffer`** to use smaller chunks, which can help the model focus and improve accuracy on long documents.\n",
        "- **Refine the few-shot `examples`** by adding more diverse and borderline cases, so the model learns better how to separate overlapping opinions and audience reactions.\n",
        "- **Tighten the prompt** by clarifying what should be considered a single extraction span and giving more precise definitions of each attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the grounded extraction is already useful, but tuning these parameters and examples would likely improve both coverage and precision.\n"

        "Comparing the 2D and 3D UMAP projections, we can see that:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Overall structure is similar**:  \n",
        "   Points with the same emotion label (anger, fear, joy, sadness) are still highly mixed, and there is no perfectly separated cluster.  \n",
        "   This is consistent with the 2D plot and reflects the fact that emotion in text is often not strictly discrete.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **3D space provides slightly better separation in some regions**:  \n",
        "   When rotating the 3D plot, some local areas show more compact groups for a given emotion (e.g., some joy or sadness points form tighter sub-clusters).  \n",
        "   This suggests that reducing from 3072 → 3 dimensions keeps a bit more structure than 3072 → 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **But there is still heavy overlap**:  \n",
        "   Because different emotions can share similar vocabulary or mixed feelings (e.g., “bittersweet”), their embeddings are naturally close in the semantic space.  \n",
        "   Also, any dimensionality reduction will lose information, so even 3D cannot fully separate all classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the 3D UMAP visualization slightly improves the separability in some local regions and is helpful to explore the structure interactively, but it still shows that emotion classes are highly entangled in the embedding space.\n"

        "\n",
        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

        "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
        "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
        "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
        "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prompt Structure:**\n",

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
